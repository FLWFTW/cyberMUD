SocketMUD(tm) was originally coded by Brian Graversen and improved upon by
the various coders in the community that took the time to return useful
feedback.

Thanks goes to Beej for his network guide, which got me started with 
network programming, and to Erwin Andreasen whose various small articles
on MUD programming and useful bits of code has helped my over the time.

Thanks also goes to all the helpful people who have spend the time to help
me improve on the original SocketMUD(tm) release.
