SocketMUD(tm) is released under Public Domain. Parts of the code was 
written by Erwin Andreasen (http://www.andreasen.org/), and even though
the code written by Erwin is also public domain, it would be nice if any 
user of this codebase would keep the credits for Erwin. The copyover and 
buffer code is inspired, converted and sometimes copy/pasted from the code 
found on his website.

The MUD has support for the mud compression protocol (MCCP), and thus
contains the mccp.c file by Oliver Jowett. The only restrictions enforced
by this, is that the mccp.c file contains the original header (as stated
in the header file).

The are no restrictions of any kind on the rest of SocketMUD(tm).
