SocketMud version 2.4

Little mud project, which has a command interpreter and supports
ANSI colors... has a nifty little help file system, and a few
commands (say, quit, who, etc). Also supports MCCP version 1 and 2.

Simply type 'make' in the ../src/ directory, and start the mud
by typing './SocketMud &'. You can now connect by telnetting
to port 9009 on localhost (or whatever machine it runs on).

Thanks goes to the community of coders that have helped with bugfixes, 
typos, ideas and improvements on the codebase.

ANSI C
======
For those wanting the code to compile with the -ansi flag (for ANSI C
compliance), I have made sure that almost the entire codebase works
out of the box - there are only three functions giving problems. These
are the isascii() macro, the gethostbyaddr_r() function and the
vsnprintf() function call. The first macro is easy enough to fix, simply
add something like this to mud.h

#define isascii(c)              (((c) & ~0x7f) == 0)

The call to gethostbyaddr_r() will probably be the worst part. The only
real solution I see, is to remove the threaded calls for DNS lookups,
and simple live with using gethostbyaddr() calls.

The vsnprintf() call can simply be replaced by vsprintf(), though you
will then risk writing beyond the end of the buffer.
