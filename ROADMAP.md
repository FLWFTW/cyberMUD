### Skill System (partially implemented)
  [ ] Skill bases
      [ ] Combat
      [ ] Engineering
      [ ] Subterfuge
      [ ] Medicine
      [ ] Misc (Need a better name, thinking "personality" or "cool", not sure, but skill tree will include things like speech, gambling, driving, and other skills that don't fall into the above branches)
  Note: As you become adept at skills you unlock additional skills in the skill tree. I'm thinking a mix between the system in Skyrim and stock SMAUG. Instead of choosing a class you advance skill trees (see above), each skill in a tree has requirements and prerequisites before you can practice it (Like in Skyrim). Once you choose a skill in a skill tree you must use it to practice it and become better at it (Like in SMAUG) and unlock further skills.

### Misc
  [ ] Hacking system, really need to put some brain power into this one. Want something that's fun and useful, be able to lock or unlock doors in a facility, activate/deactivate security systems, or reprogram them to target other people. Lock out reinforcements if you're in the middle of combat, etc.
  [ ] Weather system. Thinking of just using whatever the weather in San Francisco (Where this MUD is based) is in real time.
  [ ] Crafting System. Players can create or modify weapons, computers, armor, software.
  [ ] Ecomomy.
  [ ] Vehicles and vehicle combat
  [ ] Advanced scripting
    [ ]  Conversation system with NPCs, like in the Fallout series, where you choose branches which are influenced by your stats, skills, etc.
    [ ]  Dynamic room descriptions
    [ ]  Scripted commands and skills
    [ ]  Sandbox for player created software
