TODO:
- [ ] Combat System
- [ ] Skill System (partially implemented)
      * Skill bases
      * Combat
      * Engineering
      * Subterfuge
      * Medicine
      * Misc (Need a better name, thinking "personality", not sure, but skill tree will include things like speech, gambling, driving, and other skills that don't fall into the above branches)
      * As you become adept at skills you unlock additional skills in the skill tree. I'm thinking a mix between the system in Skyrim and stock SMAUG, where you become better at skills as you use them. Perhaps you can only learn a skill after completing a quest from a guild or faction, and then only if you have the skill unlocked.
      
- [ ] Hacking system, really need to put some brain power into this one. Want something that's fun and useful, be able to lock or unlock doors in a facility, activate/deactivate security systems, or reprogram them to target other people. Lock out reinforcements if you're in the middle of combat, etc.
